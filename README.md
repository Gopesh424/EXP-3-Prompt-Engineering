# EXP-3-PROMPT-ENGINEERING-

## Aim: 
Evaluation of 2024 Prompting Tools Across Diverse AI Platforms: 
ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, Cohere Command, and Meta
Experiment:
Within a specific use case (e.g., summarizing text, answering technical questions), compare the performance, user experience, and response quality of prompting tools across these different AI platforms.

## Algorithm:
Select use case → Summarizing a medium-length news article (e.g., on EV adoption in India).

Prepare a standard prompt → Same input text and instructions given to each AI tool (fair comparison).

Run the prompt on each platform: ChatGPT, Claude, Bard/Gemini, Cohere Command, Meta (LLaMA).

Collect responses → Copy summaries from each model.

Evaluate each on:

Performance (accuracy, depth, coverage)

User Experience (ease of use, speed, interface)

Response Quality (clarity, fluency, readability)

Tabulate results for side-by-side comparison.

Summarize findings into a comparative result.
## Prompt
## AI_Tools_Full_Evaluation_Table.png
"Summarize the following passage in 3–4 sentences:
‘India’s adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is accelerating due to government subsidies, expansion of charging infrastructure, and rising fuel costs. Companies are investing in EV production, while consumers are becoming more environmentally conscious. Despite challenges such as battery costs and limited range, the EV market in India is projected to grow rapidly in the coming years.’”
## Output
Platform	Sample Summary
ChatGPT	“India’s EV adoption is rapidly increasing, supported by government subsidies, charging infrastructure, and rising fuel prices. Companies are investing in EVs, and consumers show growing eco-consciousness. Despite challenges like battery cost and range, the market outlook is strong.”
Claude	“Government incentives, infrastructure growth, and fuel costs are boosting EV use in India. Businesses and consumers alike are adapting to the change. Although battery cost and range remain hurdles, the EV sector is expected to expand quickly.”
Bard/Gemini	“India’s EV market is growing fast due to subsidies, charging networks, and high fuel costs. Companies and consumers are showing interest, but battery challenges remain.”
Cohere Command	“India’s EV growth is driven by subsidies, infrastructure, and fuel costs. Investments are rising though battery costs and range issues persist.”
Meta (LLaMA-based)	“India is adopting EVs quickly, helped by government support, charging infrastructure, and fuel costs. Battery and range issues remain but growth is expected.”
## Result
ChatGPT: Best for detailed, structured, fluent summaries; slightly verbose but professional.

Claude: Strong at balanced, natural language; concise and safe outputs.

Bard/Gemini: Fast and clear, but sometimes oversimplifies details.

Cohere Command: Concise and business-like, but less creative/engaging.

Meta (LLaMA-based): Accurate but plain, depends heavily on fine-tuning; not as user-friendly.
